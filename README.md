# Clone of NagaEight.com

This project is build to clone https://nagaeight.com.

I rewrite this website to use React rather using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- Reactjs

To start local development you need to clone this project.

After the repository cloned run `yarn install` or `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
